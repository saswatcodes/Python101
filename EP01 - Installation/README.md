## 3. Testing Python on Terminal / Command Prompt

In the previous step, we have successfully installed Python in our system and now we have to check if our process was right or not.
For that we will run some python commands in our terminal / command prompt.

- Search CMD on your PC (Windows) and open it.

------------ | ------------ |
Searching CMD on Windows | CMD Interface

- So, this is the CMD or Command Prompt interface and we will test the Python here.
- Type `python` or `py` and press **Enter**.
    `C:\Users\saswa>python`
        OR
     `C:\Users\saswa>py`
- It will return a result like this

    ```
    Python 3.9.2 (tags/v3.9.2:1a79785, Feb 19 2021, 13:44:55) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    ```
- So, if you get the output as this, then the Python is successfully installed in your system and is successfully executed.
    - Note that here, `Python 3.9.2` is the installed version in my system. It may vary if you have installed other versions. So, don't panic.

- Now let's run some simple Python snippets and test the execution

    ```
    >>> print("Hello, World!")
    Hello, World!
    >>> print(5+10)
    15
    >>> a=10, b=109
    File "<stdin>", line 1
    a=10, b=109
      ^
    SyntaxError: cannot assign to literal
    >>> a = 10
    >>> b = 201
    >>> print(a+b)
    211
    >>> print("Thank You!")
    Thank You!
    >>>
    ```
- So all our code snippets are working properly. And hence the installation of Python in our system is successfull now with testing in CMD.
